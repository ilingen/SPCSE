# SPCSE
The implementation code of SPCSE. 

# Train
In the following section, we describe how to train a SPCSE model by using our code.

### Requirements

First, install PyTorch by following the instructions from [the official website](https://pytorch.org). To faithfully reproduce our results, please use the correct `1.7.1` version corresponding to your platforms/CUDA versions. PyTorch version higher than `1.7.1` should also work. For example, if you use Linux and **CUDA11** ([how to check CUDA version](https://varhowto.com/check-cuda-version/)), install PyTorch by the following command,

```bash
pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

If you instead use **CUDA** `<11` or **CPU**, install PyTorch by the following command,

```bash
pip install torch==1.7.1
```


Then run the following script to install the remaining dependencies,

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
